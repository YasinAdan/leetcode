Big O Notation

1 linear time O(n) - as n increases, run time increases
2 constant time O(1) - as n increases, run time doesnt increase
3 quadratic time (n^2) - as n increase, run time doubles
Ex: 1
T = a(n) + b = O(n) *(a & b) are constants, meaning they don't grow
    - find the fastest growing term - a(n)
    - take out the coeffient - n


Ex: 2
T = cn^2 + dn + e = O(n^2) * (e) is a constant
    - find the fastest growing term - cn^2
    - take out the coeffient - n^2
